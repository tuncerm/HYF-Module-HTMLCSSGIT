1. How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
    In order to make a file or folder hidden, we need to put a dot(.) in front of the folder name.
    (e.g. "mkdir .smt")
    To list the hidden files and folders, using "a" as a flag with the ls command is sufficient. (e.g. "ls -a")
    Using capital 'A' might work better in most cases. It will ignore current and parent annotations.

    P.S. This "." will not work on Microsoft Operating Systems. In windows attributes can be used.

2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?
    This one is a tricky one. One can just go through all of it and use "mkdir these", cd these, "mkdir folders" and so on.
    Or use the "p" flag which stands for parent. I am not on a windows machine so,
    "mkdir -p ~/these/folders/are/just/for/fun"
    is sufficient in my case.

    p.s. If you want to remove these folders, just use "rm -r ~/these".

3. How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:
    first message
    second message

    One can just Open the file, type in the message and save.

    Or, use echo with 2 bigger than signs (>>), which means append, to append at the end of the file.
    (echo "Your Message Here" >> "Your FileName Here")

    P.S. Here the file system actually helps us. A new line character is automatically added at the end of the file.
    One can check to see if it is so, easily by typing something at the end of a file in the code editor.
    As soon as it is saved, a new line will appear at the end.
